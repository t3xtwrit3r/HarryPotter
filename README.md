This project will only run on Android Studio Giraffe. 
I have used the latest AGP and Gradle with the latest Kotlin (1.9.0).
I have used the MVVM Architecture Pattern in this project. I have used Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection and the Android Navigation component for navigation.
I have used Data binding and View Binding both to bind data to views.
The offline cache could be implemented here using Room Database and a periodic work manager.
